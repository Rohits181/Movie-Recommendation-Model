# Movie-Recommendation-Model

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using similarity-based filtering.  
By analyzing user preferences and calculating similarity scores between movies, the system suggests movies that are most similar to a given title.  

---

## Analysis  
- The dataset contains information about movies, including their titles and metadata (genres, ratings, etc.).  
- The problem is **recommendation**, where the goal is to suggest movies based on similarity with a chosen movie.  
- Text processing and feature extraction methods are used to represent movies in a structured format.  
- Similarity is computed using techniques like **correlation coefficients** or **cosine similarity** between feature vectors.

## Summary  
The purpose of this project is to build a system that can recommend **top N movies similar to a given movie title**.  

Steps carried out:  
1. Import the movie dataset and preprocess it (handle missing values, select features).  
2. Represent each movie as a feature vector.  
3. Compute similarity scores between all movies.  
4. Build a recommendation function that:  
   - Takes a movie name as input.  
   - Returns the **top 10 most similar movies**.  
5. Display results to the user.

## Results  
- The system successfully generates relevant recommendations for any input movie.  
- Example: If the input is *"The Dark Knight"*, the system may recommend *"Batman Begins"*, *"Inception"*, or *"The Dark Knight Rises"*.  
- Recommendations are ranked by similarity scores.

## Analysis and Insights  
- **Similarity-based recommendations** work well when movies share strong correlations in features such as genres, cast, or ratings.  
- Correlation matrices and similarity scores help identify clusters of similar movies.  
- The system can be extended to hybrid approaches (content + collaborative filtering) for even better accuracy.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations  
- Enhance the system by integrating **user rating histories** to personalize results.  
- Use **cosine similarity with TF-IDF** on movie descriptions for richer recommendations.  
- Deploy the recommendation function as a **web app** using Streamlit or Flask for interactive usage.  
- Continuously update the dataset to include new movies for fresh recommendations.
